# Canva Explorer Skill

A **read-only** skill for discovering and browsing your Canva account. This skill NEVER modifies anything - it only retrieves and displays information.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- See what designs they have
- Browse their folder structure
- Find a specific design by name
- Get details about a design (pages, dimensions, type)
- View their account information
- List assets in their library
- Search for designs by type or date

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Query
Determine what the user wants to explore:
- All designs? Specific folder? Specific design?
- Need metadata? Just names? Page counts?

### Step 2: Run Discovery Scripts
Execute the appropriate script(s):

```bash
# Get account info and verify connection
python skills/canva-explorer/scripts/auth_check.py

# List all designs
python skills/canva-explorer/scripts/list_designs.py

# List folder structure
python skills/canva-explorer/scripts/list_folders.py

# Get specific design details
python skills/canva-explorer/scripts/get_design.py --id "DESIGN_ID"

# List folder contents
python skills/canva-explorer/scripts/list_folder_contents.py --folder "FOLDER_ID"

# Search designs by name
python skills/canva-explorer/scripts/search_designs.py --query "search term"
```

### Step 3: Present Results Clearly
Format the results in a user-friendly way:

```

### Account Info
- User: [Display Name]

## Output Location

- `output/logs/` - Operation logs

## Safety Notes

- No designs, folders, or assets are ever modified
- Results are cached locally for quick re-access
- Large accounts may take time to fully enumerate
