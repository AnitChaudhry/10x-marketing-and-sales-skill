## The 11 Commandments

### 1. Remove as much text as possible
Every word must earn its place. If removing it doesn't hurt, remove it.

### 2. Write the strongest true statement that you can
Don't hedge. "Might help" → "Helps". "Could save" → "Saves".

### 3. What sells in-person sells online
The same objections, proofs, and emotional hooks that work face-to-face work in copy.

### 4. It's not about you; it's about what's in it for them
Transform every sentence:
- "We built..." → "You get..."
- "Our technology..." → "This means you can..."

### 5. Cleverness is the enemy, clarity is the antidote
If you have to choose between clever and clear, choose clear. Always.

### 6. Write like someone you'd want to buy from
Clear, confident, honest, and (if brand appropriate) funny.

### 7. Write for the person on the fence
They're interested but skeptical. Address their doubts directly.

### 8. Write melodically
Vary sentence length. Short sentences punch. Longer sentences provide rhythm and flow that keeps readers engaged.

### 9. Write for scannability
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Bold key phrases
- Bullet points for lists
- Clear section headers

### 10. Write for bookiness
The subheads alone should tell 90% of the story. Someone scanning just the headers should understand your value.

### 11. Get them nodding about the problem, then show the solution
Agitate the pain first. Make them think "yes, that's exactly my problem" before revealing your solution.

## CTA Copy Guidelines

### Expose the Value
Make the value visible and close-at-hand:
- ❌ "Sign up" → ✅ "Start your 14-day free trial"
- ❌ "Subscribe" → ✅ "Start learning French"
- ❌ "Submit" → ✅ "Reserve My Free Spot"

### Address Objections in CTA
- Time objection: "Get started in 60 seconds"
- Money objection: "Start free, no credit card"
- Trust objection: "Try risk-free for 30 days"

### Don't Make Users Dread Clicking
- ❌ "Sign up for emails"
- ✅ Something they'd actually want to click
