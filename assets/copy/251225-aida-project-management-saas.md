### Your Team Deserves Better Than Spreadsheet Hell

Every week, your team loses 12+ hours to status meetings, scattered updates, and the dreaded "where's that file?" hunt.

**The cost?** Missed deadlines. Frustrated clients. Burned-out team members.

Imagine this instead: Every project, task, and conversation in one clean dashboard. Real-time progress without the sync meetings. Files attached exactly where they belong.

**ProjectFlow brings order to the chaos:**
- Visual timelines that update automatically
- Team workload balancing at a glance
- Client portals that eliminate endless emails

## Long Version (Sales Page)

### Your Projects Are Falling Through the Cracks

You've tried the spreadsheets. The Slack channels. The "quick" status meetings that eat half your Monday.

And still, deadlines slip. Team members work on outdated versions. Clients email asking for updates you already sent.

**Here's what that chaos costs you:**
- 12.4 hours per employee, per week—lost to coordination overhead
- 3x longer feedback cycles when work lives in scattered tools
- 23% of projects delivered late because "someone didn't get the memo"

You don't have a team problem. You have a visibility problem.

### What If You Could See Everything at a Glance?

Picture this:

You open one dashboard. Every project status—updated in real time. Every task—assigned, deadlined, and tracked. Every file—attached to the work it belongs to.

No more syncing three tools. No more "I thought you had that." No more fire drills before client calls.

**ProjectFlow gives you:**

**Visual Project Timelines**
Drag-and-drop Gantt charts that update when work actually moves. See blockers before they become crises.

**Smart Workload Balancing**
Color-coded capacity views. Reassign tasks before anyone burns out.

**Client Collaboration Portals**
Share progress without forwarding emails. Clients see what you want them to see—nothing more.

**Automated Status Reports**
One click. Beautiful PDF. Your Friday afternoon back.
