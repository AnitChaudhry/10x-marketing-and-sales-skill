## Email Body

Real talk:

I built [Product] because I was drowning.

Three years ago, I was managing projects across 7 different tools. Slack pings at midnight. Spreadsheets that broke when someone sneezed. Status meetings that could've been a dashboard.

Sound familiar?

The breaking point came when we lost a $50K client because a task fell through the cracks. Nobody knew who owned it. Nobody saw it slip.

That's when I stopped looking for a tool and started building one.

**Our mission is simple:** One place to see everything. Zero tasks falling through cracks.

We're not trying to be everything. We're trying to be the one thing you actually check every morning.

Tomorrow, I'll share the #1 feature that saves our users 5+ hours weekly. Most people miss it.

Stay tuned,
