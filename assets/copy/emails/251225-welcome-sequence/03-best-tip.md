## Email Body

Here's something that separates power users from everyone else:

**The Dashboard Automations feature.**

Most people set up their projects manually. Every. Single. Time.

Power users? They build templates once and launch projects in 30 seconds.

**Here's how:**

1. Go to Settings → Automations
2. Click "Create Template"
3. Add your recurring tasks, assignments, and due dates
4. Save

Now whenever you start a similar project, one click does what used to take 30 minutes.

**Real example:** Our customer Sarah runs a marketing agency. She launches 12 client projects per month. Used to take 4 hours of setup. Now? 6 minutes total.

That's the power of working smarter.

Want me to set this up for you? Just reply "AUTOMATE" and I'll send you a 5-minute video walkthrough.

Cheers,
[Founder Name]
