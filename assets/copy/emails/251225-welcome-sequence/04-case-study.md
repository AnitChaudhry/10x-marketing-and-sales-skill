## Email Body

I want to introduce you to Marcus.

Marcus runs engineering at TechScale (127 employees, Series B startup). When he found us, his team was:

- Missing 30% of sprint deadlines
- Spending 6+ hours/week in status meetings
- Using 4 different tools that didn't talk to each other

**Sound familiar?**

Here's what changed in 90 days:

✓ Sprint completion: 30% → 94%
✓ Status meetings: 6 hours → 45 minutes/week
✓ Tools consolidated: 4 → 1

**His secret?** He didn't just adopt the tool. He adopted the workflow.

"We stopped asking 'where is this?' and started asking 'what's next?'" — Marcus R., VP Engineering

The workflow that worked for Marcus is the same one we recommend to every new user.

I put together a 10-minute video showing exactly how to set it up.

Want it? Just reply "WORKFLOW" and I'll send it over.

Best,
[Founder Name]

## P.S.
P.S. — Marcus was skeptical at first too. "Another project tool?" Now he's our biggest advocate.
