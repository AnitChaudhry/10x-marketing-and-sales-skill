## Email Body

Hey,

You've been using [Product] for 2 weeks now.

I'm not going to pitch you. Instead, let me help you decide:

**Upgrade if:**
- You've created 3+ projects
- Your team is actively using it
- You've saved time on status updates

**Stay on free if:**
- You're still exploring
- Solo projects only
- You need more time

No pressure either way. The free plan works forever.

But if you're seeing results, here's what Pro unlocks:

→ Unlimited projects (vs. 3)
→ Advanced automations
→ Team analytics dashboard
→ Priority support

**For the next 48 hours**, use code WELCOME20 for 20% off your first 3 months.

That's $47/mo instead of $59/mo for your whole team.

No annual commitment required.

Questions? Just reply. I'm here.

## CTA
**Button:** Upgrade with 20% Off →
**Link:** {app_url}/upgrade?code=WELCOME20

## P.S.
P.S. — If now's not the right time, no worries. You can always upgrade later at full price. But the 20% code expires in 48 hours.
