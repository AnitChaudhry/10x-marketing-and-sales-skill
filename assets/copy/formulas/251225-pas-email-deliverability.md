## Short Version (Social/Ad)

Your emails are landing in spam. Every campaign you send, fewer people see it. Meanwhile, your competitors hit primary inbox every time.

Our deliverability toolkit monitors, diagnoses, and fixes inbox placement issues before they tank your metrics.

## Medium Version (Email/Landing)
**~150 words**

**Your emails aren't reaching your subscribers.**

You're sending newsletters, sequences, and campaigns—but open rates keep dropping. Unsubscribes climb. Revenue from email shrinks quarter after quarter.

Here's what's actually happening: spam filters are silently killing your messages. Domain reputation issues. Authentication failures. Content triggers. Each one sends more of your emails into the void.

**The cost is real:** A 10% drop in deliverability on a 50K list means 5,000 people never see your message. That's leads lost, revenue gone, relationships severed.

Our Email Deliverability Toolkit gives you:
- Real-time inbox placement monitoring
- Domain reputation scoring
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC diagnostic reports
- Content spam trigger analysis
- Automated warm-up sequences

Know exactly where your emails land. Fix problems before they cost you.

## Long Version (Sales Page)
**~300 words**

**Your emails are disappearing. And you don't even know it.**

You've spent hours crafting the perfect email. Subject line A/B tested. Copy polished. CTA optimized. You hit send to your list of 50,000 subscribers.

But here's what actually happens: 12,000 of those emails never reach the inbox. They're filtered, flagged, or straight-up blocked. Your open rate shows 18%—but the real number? Maybe 25% of those who actually received it.

**This silent failure is costing you thousands every month.**

Every email that lands in spam is a customer who'll never see your offer. A lead who'll go cold. A subscriber who'll eventually forget you exist and hit "unsubscribe" on the one email that does get through.

The worst part? Most SaaS founders have no idea this is happening. They blame the subject line. They try new templates. They keep optimizing the wrong thing.

**The problem isn't your content. It's your infrastructure.**

- Domain reputation tanked by a bad send six months ago
- SPF records misconfigured during your last domain migration
- DKIM signatures failing silently
- Content patterns triggering Gmail's filters
- IP reputation inherited from shared sending infrastructure

Our Email Deliverability Toolkit exposes all of it:

**Inbox Placement Monitoring** — See exactly where emails land across Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and 20+ providers.

**Reputation Dashboard** — Track domain and IP reputation scores with daily alerts.

**Authentication Diagnostics** — One-click verification of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC setup.

**Content Analysis** — Scan your emails for spam trigger words and patterns before you send.

**Warm-up Automation** — Gradually rebuild reputation with automated engagement sequences.

Stop guessing why your emails aren't working. Start knowing.
