1/ In 2012, a Korean artist released a song mocking Seoul's elite.

It became the first YouTube video to hit 1 BILLION views.

5.79 billion views later, "Gangnam Style" remains a masterclass in viral content.

2/ The genius wasn't the dance.

It was the contrast:
- Absurd visuals + catchy beat
- Satirical lyrics + party energy
- Local reference + universal appeal

PSY turned cultural commentary into global entertainment.

3/ The numbers are insane:

- First to 1B views (Dec 2012)
- First to 2B views (May 2014)
- Held #1 spot for 5 years
- 31.2M likes
- Still gaining 2M+ views/month

4/ Marketing lessons from Gangnam Style:

- Authenticity > polish (that horse dance was ridiculous)
- Humor transcends language
- Timing matters (YouTube algorithm was ripe)
- Embrace the weird

5/ PSY could've been a one-hit wonder.

Instead, he built an empire, signed artists, and proved K-pop could conquer the West.

5.79 billion views. 31.2 million likes. Zero paid promotion.

In 2012, PSY released "Gangnam Style" - a satirical song about Seoul's wealthy district.

What happened next changed music marketing forever.

**The strategy that worked:**

1. **Authentic absurdity** - The horse dance wasn't focus-grouped. It was genuine weirdness that made people share.

2. **Cultural specificity → Universal appeal** - The more Korean it was, the more the world loved it. Lesson: Don't dilute your voice for global audiences.

3. **Platform timing** - YouTube was maturing. Mobile was growing. The algorithm rewarded watch time, and people replayed this endlessly.

4. **Zero gatekeepers** - No record label "strategy." No PR firm. Just content that people wanted to share.

**The result:**
- First video to 1 billion views
- Billboard #2 (highest for a Korean artist at the time)
- Opened the door for BTS, BLACKPINK, and K-pop's global dominance

The best marketing still can't be manufactured. It can only be authentic.

What's a campaign you've seen that succeeded by being genuinely different?
