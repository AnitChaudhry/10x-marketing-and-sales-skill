1/ In 1987, a 21-year-old kid from Newton-le-Willows recorded a song that would become the most successful internet meme of all time.

1.7 billion views later, Rick Astley still hasn't given us up.

Here's the wild story 🧵

2/ The video was directed by Simon West—who later made Con Air and Tomb Raider.

He had no idea he was creating the foundation for internet culture.

3/ "Rickrolling" started in 2007 on 4chan.

18 years later, the video crossed 1 BILLION views.

Even @YouTube's official account commented: "can confirm: he never gave us up" (151K likes)

The most-watched music video on YouTube (1.7 billion views) wasn't created by an algorithm.

It was recorded in 1987 by a 21-year-old named Rick Astley.

No social media strategy. No influencer marketing. No paid promotion.

Just a catchy song and an authentic performance.

Here's what marketers can learn from "Never Gonna Give You Up":

**1. Authenticity wins long-term**
The Rickroll meme wasn't manufactured. It emerged organically. The best viral content can't be forced.

**2. Consistency matters**
The lyrics promise to "never give you up." Rick has never stopped performing. 38 years later, he's still delivering.

**3. Embrace the unexpected**
When the internet turned his song into a meme, Rick didn't fight it. He leaned in. He Rickrolled people himself.

The result? A second career peak decades after the original.

Sometimes the best marketing strategy is simply being genuine and adaptable.
