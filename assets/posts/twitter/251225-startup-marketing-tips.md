## Tweet 1 (Hook)

I've helped 50+ startups go from $0 to first customers.

Here are 5 marketing tips I wish someone told me on day 1:

🧵👇

## Tweet 2 (Tip #1)

**1. Talk to 100 potential customers before spending $1 on ads**

Most founders build, then market.

Winners validate, then build.

Cold DMs are free. Use them.

---

## Tweet 3 (Tip #2)

**2. Pick ONE channel and dominate it**

Startups die from spreading too thin:
- Twitter + LinkedIn + TikTok + YouTube = mediocre everywhere

Better:
- Twitter only = authority in 6 months

Expand after you've won one.

## Tweet 4 (Tip #3)

**3. Document, don't create**

Content creation burnout is real.

Instead: Share your journey.
- What you're building
- Problems you're solving
- Lessons from failures

Authentic > Polished

## Tweet 5 (Tip #4)

**4. Build in public, but ship in private**

Share your wins and struggles publicly.

But validate your ideas in DMs with real prospects before announcing.

Public accountability. Private validation.

---

## Tweet 6 (Tip #5 + CTA)

**5. Your first 100 customers are found, not attracted**

Stop waiting for inbound.

Go where your customers hang out:
- Reddit threads
- Discord servers
- LinkedIn comments
- Twitter replies

Hunt them down. Serve them obsessively.

---

## Tweet 7 (Wrap)

TL;DR:

1. Talk to 100 customers first
2. Pick ONE channel
3. Document your journey
4. Build public, validate private
5. Find customers, don't wait

Save this thread. You'll need it.
