# Stop Juggling 10 Marketing Tools. Let 27 AI Agents Do the Work.

**TL;DR:** ClaudeKit Marketing replaces your scattered marketing stack with a unified AI team that works 24/7. 27 specialized agents. One command. $99.

## The Marketing Tool Trap

You're running a SaaS or indie product. Marketing is eating you alive.

**Your current stack looks something like this:**
- Jasper for copy ($49/mo)
- SEMrush for SEO ($119/mo)
- Mailchimp for email ($20/mo)
- Canva for design ($12/mo)
- Buffer for social ($15/mo)
- Google Analytics for data (free but painful)
- 4+ more tools you forgot you're paying for

**Total: $200-500/month.** Plus the cognitive tax of context-switching between 10 different interfaces. Plus the hours spent copying data from one tool to another.

And the worst part? These tools don't talk to each other. Your SEO research doesn't automatically inform your content. Your email sequences don't align with your funnel strategy. Everything is fragmented.

## What If Your Entire Marketing Team Was One Command?

Imagine typing:

```bash
/plan "Q1 product launch campaign"
```

And watching as specialized AI agents:
- Research your market and competitors
- Draft your landing page copy
- Create your email nurture sequence
- Optimize for SEO
- Generate social media content
- Track everything in one place

That's ClaudeKit Marketing.

## 27 Agents. One Brain.

| Funnel Stage | Agents | What They Do |
|--------------|--------|--------------|
| **TOFU** | Attraction Specialist, SEO Specialist, Lead Qualifier, Researcher | Generate leads, rank content, qualify prospects |
| **MOFU** | Email Wizard, Sale Enabler, Funnel Architect, Content Creator | Nurture leads, create content, build funnels |
| **BOFU** | Upsell Maximizer | Maximize customer value |
| **Core** | Copywriter, Brainstormer, Campaign Manager, Content Reviewer | Create, ideate, manage, quality-check |

These agents don't just work independently—they coordinate. The SEO Specialist's research informs the Copywriter's headlines. The Campaign Debugger's insights feed back to the Funnel Architect. It's the marketing team you can't afford to hire, working in perfect sync.

## Before & After

**BEFORE ClaudeKit:**
Sarah, a solo founder, spent 4 hours daily on marketing. Writing blog posts. Tweaking email sequences. Researching keywords. Her product was great, but nobody knew it existed.

**AFTER ClaudeKit:**
Same Sarah runs `/content/good "weekly blog post on productivity hacks"` and gets SEO-optimized, brand-consistent content in minutes. She spends 30 minutes reviewing and scheduling what used to take 4 hours to create from scratch.

**The bridge?** 27 AI agents that understand marketing strategy—not just content generation.

---

## Why This Is Different

**Not another AI writer.** Tools like Jasper or Copy.ai generate text. ClaudeKit Marketing orchestrates campaigns. There's a difference between having a copywriter and having a marketing team.

**Built on Claude Code.** This isn't a wrapper around ChatGPT. It's native to Anthropic's Claude Code framework, using subagent orchestration to coordinate specialized AI agents.

**Real integrations.** 8 MCP servers connect to your actual marketing stack:
- Google Analytics 4
- Google Ads
- Google Search Console
- SendGrid / Resend
- Discord / Slack
- ReviewWeb SEO intelligence

**73+ commands.** Not a blank prompt box. Structured commands that trigger proven workflows.

## What You Can Do Today

```bash
# Plan your Q1 campaign
/plan "product launch for new feature"

# Create high-converting copy
/content/good "landing page for [product]"

# Optimize for conversions
/content/cro "improve checkout page conversion"

# Generate campaign ideas
/brainstorm "Black Friday email sequence"

# Research competitors

```

---

## Who It's For

- **Indie hackers** who can't hire a marketing team
- **Small marketing teams (1-5)** overwhelmed by execution
- **SMB marketing managers** drowning in tools and tasks

If you're spending more time managing marketing tools than marketing, this is for you.

## The Math

| Tool Stack | Monthly Cost | Annual |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Jasper + SEMrush + Mailchimp + Canva + Buffer + extras | $200-500/mo | $2,400-6,000 |
| **ClaudeKit Marketing** | **$99 one-time** | **$99** |

That's not a typo. One-time payment. Forever access.
